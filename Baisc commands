In computing, a shebang is the character sequence consisting of the characters number sign and exclamation mark (#!) at the beginning of a script. It is also called sha-bang,[1][2] hashbang,[3][4] pound-bang,[5] or hash-pling.[6]

Under Unix-like operating systems, when a script with a shebang is run as a program, the program loader parses the rest of the script's initial line as an interpreter directive; the specified interpreter program is run instead, passing to it as an argument the path that was initially used when attempting to run the script.[7] For example, if a script is named with the path path/to/script, and it starts with the following line:

#!/bin/sh


awk '{print $1}' your_file --- first word in every line of file

awk '{print $NF}' abc ---- last word in every line of file
