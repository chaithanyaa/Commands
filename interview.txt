Command is used to list the files and directories in Linux (except ls) ----- echo or find command
Ans:
 echo *                                 ---- just list files
find . -printf "%M\t%u\t%g\t%p\n"       ----- same as ls 


Command is a program. Has 4 types.

1.External command
2.Builtin Command
3.shell function
4.Alias


which ---- exact binary path of the  external command
type  ----  exact binary path of other three.

tar --- archiver
        can  be compressed by gzip-- first make a single file and then compress 
		persvere much more metadata information
		
zip --- archiver and compressor


What is Sticky Bit?

The sticky bit is used to indicate special permissions for files and directories. If a directory with sticky bit enabled will restrict deletion of the file inside it. It can be removed by root, owner of the file or who have to write permission on it. This is useful for publically accessible directories like /tmp.


Here is the implementation of Sticky bit on file on Linux system.
Method 1:

$ chmod +t tecadmin.txt
$ ls -l tecadmin.txt
-rw-r--r-T 1 root root 0 Mar  8 02:06 tecadmin.txt
Mothod 2:

# chmod 1777 tecadmin.txt
# ls -l tecadmin.txt
-rwxrwxrwt 1 root root 0 Mar  8 02:06 tecadmin.txt
In above output it showing sticky bit is set with character t or T in permissions filed. Small t represent that execute permission also enable and capital T represent that execute permission are not enabled.

What is SUID (setuid)?

If SUID bit is set on a file and a user executed it. The process will have the same rights as the owner of the file being executed.

For example: passwd command have SUID bit enabled. When a normal user changes his password this script update few system files like /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow which can’t be updated by non-root account. So that passwd command process always run with root user rights.

Here is the implementation of SUID on file under Linux system.

Mehtod 1:

# chmod u+s tecadmin.txt
# ls -l tecadmin.txt
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Mar  8 02:06 tecadmin.txt
Method 2:

# chmod 4655 tecadmin.txt
# ls -l tecadmin.txt
-rwSr-xr-x 1 root root 0 Mar  8 02:06 tecadmin.txt
What is SGID (setgid)?

Same as SUID, The process will have the same group rights of the file being executed. If SGID bit is set on any directory, all subdirectories and files created inside will get same group ownership as the main directory, it doesn’t matter who is creating.

Here is the implementation of SGID on directory on Linux system.

# chmod g+s /test/
# ls -ld /test
drwxrwsrwx 2 root root 4096 Mar  8 03:12 /test
Now swich to other user and create a file in /test directory.

# su - tecadmin
$ cd /test/
$ touch tecadmin.net.txt
$ ls -l tecadmin.net.txt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 tecadmin root 0 Mar  8 03:13 tecadmin.net.txt
In above example tecadmin.net.txt is created with root group ownership.





netstat -tulpn | grep 8080
